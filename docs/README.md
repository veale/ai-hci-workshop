## Accepted Papers 

#### Human+AI Modeling & Design
* [Building Shared Mental Models between Humans and AI for Effective Collaboration.](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~harmank/Papers/CHI2019_MentalModels_HAI.pdf) **Harmanpreet Kaur (University of Michigan)**; **Alex C. Williams (University of Waterloo)**; Walter S. Lasecki (University of Michigan) 
    * <details><summary>Click for abstract</summary> Intelligent systems have become increasingly common in settings ranging from performing everyday tasks more easily to decision-making for complex domains (e.g., healthcare, autonomous driving, criminal justice). Given this rising ubiquity of artificial intelligence (AI), both researchers and industry practitioners are exploring ways to better integrate AI agents in tasks that people do at home or work. However, these systems are currently limited because of gaps in the understanding between humans and their AI counterparts. In this paper, we propose methods for building shared mental models between humans and AI to enable human-AI collaboration at a level where both can be equal partners working on a shared task. We ground our approach in existing literature from CSCW and UX design.</details><br/>

    * <details><summary>Click for abstract</summary>  Through several case studies on organizations deploying AI, we have started to develop a framework human–AI collaboration and its management in work contexts. The literature on distributed cognition, in which organizational activities are viewed as an alliance of computation-capable agents, humans and computers alike, offers several useful concepts and viewpoints for this task. In this paper, we summarise some parts of our ongoing theoretical but practice-oriented work, addressing especially the organizing for reliability of AI-based systems in high-risk contexts, the risk of worker deskilling, and management of collective knowledge across human and AI agents.</details><br/>

* [Accounting for the Human when Designing with AI - Challenges Identified.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/332510603_ACCOUNTING_FOR_THE_HUMAN_WHEN_DESIGNING_WITH_AI_-_CHALLENGES_IDENTIFIED) **Nathalie Stembert (Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences)** and Maaike Harbers (Rotterdam University of Applied Sciences)
    * <details><summary>Click for abstract</summary>  Now that the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is becoming more mainstream, it is applied in many different fields, and consequently, it is starting to play a more prominent role in design processes. In current mainstream HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) design frameworks, the human (or user) is seen as the main focus, and stakeholders’ perspectives are taken into account throughout the whole problem-solving process to design thoughtful solutions. The increased complexity of design processes caused by the rise of AI, however, pose new challenges to these existing approaches, particularly for involving the human in the design process. Five challenges that can be of influence on accounting for the human in design processes involving AI are identified and elaborated upon: 1) insufficient AI literacy of designers and users, 2) the black-box nature of neural networks, 3) where to start: design vs data, 4) customized solutions for narrow user segments, and 5) thinking ahead: an extended collaborative design process. These challenges arise across the exploration, design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment phases. This extended abstract discusses possible approaches per challenge on how to warrant integration of the human perspective.</details><br/>

* Exploring the User Experience of Artificial Intelligence Applications: User Survey and Human-AI Relationship Model. **Kaisa Väänänen (Tampere University)**, Helinä  Pohjola (Tampere University), and Aino Ahtinen (Tampere University)
    * <details><summary>Click for abstract</summary> Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications are spreading to our everyday lives. Supporting positive User Experience (UX) of novel applications is a crucial factor in the acceptance of those applications. Even though much of AI functionality happens “automatically” without users’ need to interact with it or be aware of it, issues specific to users’ perceptions of AI applications deserve attention. Whereas the AI community has started to address important issues such as transparency and bias in algorithm design, the broader UX perspective of AI applications has received less attention. In this paper we approach exploring this issue in two ways: First, by presenting results from a pilot survey on users’ perspective of AI applications and second, by proposing a model for Human-AI interaction based on the metaphor of human relationships.</details><br/>

#### AI Explainability & Experimentation
* [Describing Agent Behavior to People](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ggll3lcf9g8i4cr/strategy_summarization_human_ai_CHI_workshop_final.pdf?dl=0) **Ofra Amir (Technion - Israel Institute of Technology)**
    * <details><summary>Click for abstract</summary> People increasingly interact with AI-based agents. Improving people's ability to understand and anticipate the behavior of such agents is important as it can help facilitate trust and  collaboration between people and agents. In this paper, we review our recent efforts towards the development of methods for summarizing agent behavior to people. The goal of such summaries is to provide people with a global understanding of the agent's strategy, thus improving their understanding of the agent's strength and limitations. We present initial methods for generating such summaries, and discuss open challenges which require integration of HCI and AI perspectives.</details><br/>

    * <details><summary>Click for abstract</summary> Recommender systems (RS) are very common tools designed to help users choose items from a large number of alternatives. While research in RS has been mainly focusing on algorithmic precision, it slowly starts to take user-centric aspects into account as well. In this paper we present two demonstrative applications that target at increasing transparency and control in RS. Both prototypes follow the same method. As a baseline, the entire item space of a domain is visualized using a map-like interface. Inside this depiction users can express their preferences to which the RS reacts with matching recommendations. To change recommendations, users can alter their preferences expressed, which creates a continuous feedback loop between user and RS.</details><br/>

Willemsen (Eindhoven University of Technology), and Wijnand A. IJsselsteijn (Eindhoven University of Technology)
    * <details><summary>Click for abstract</summary> As the aim of explaining is understanding, XAI is successful when the user has a good understanding of the AI system.

M. Murali (Virginia Tech)
    * <details><summary>Click for abstract</summary> Many fields of science require meaningful and visually appealing layouts of graphs. However, the problem remains challenging due to multiple conflicting criteria and complex domain-specific constraints. In this workshop paper, we present a gamified graph layout task where the goal of the players is to create a layout that optimises a score based on user-defined priorities. We propose a novel hybrid approach wherein non-experts and simulated annealing algorithm build on each other’s progress. To facilitate this collaborative process, we have developed Flud, an online game with a purpose that leverages the combination of cognitive abilities of humans to observe patterns, and the computational accuracy of simulated annealing to draw graph layouts that can help scientists visualize and understand complex networks. visualize and understand complex networks.</details><br/>

    * <details><summary>Click for abstract</summary> In this paper we investigate the reasoning of caseworkers, in the Danish public sector, tasked with placing or moving receivers benefits in or between “target groups" for administrative purposes. The investigation aims to contribute to a discussion of collaborative decision making, which may potentially involve humans and algorithms. Our preliminary findings show that caseworkers make choices based on foundations that may differ from the assumptions of mainstream AI. As such, our study raises important questions for the design of AI, especially concerning citizen-centric casework.</details><br/>

* [Fairness Sample Complexity and the Case for Human Intervention](https://ai.google/research/pubs/pub48036). **Ananth Balashankar (New York University)**; Alyssa Lees (Google)
    * <details><summary>Click for abstract</summary> With the aim of building machine learning systems that incorporate standards of fairness and accountability, we explore explicit subgroup sample complexity bounds. The work is motivated by the observation that classifier predictions for real world datasets often demonstrate drastically different metrics, such as accuracy, when subdivided by specific sensitive variable subgroups.  The reasons for these discrepancies are varied and not limited to the influence of mitigating variables, institutional bias, underlying population distributions as well as sampling bias. Among the numerous definitions of fairness that exist, we argue that at a minimum, principled ML practices should ensure that classification predictions are able to mirror the underlying sub-population distributions.  However, as the number of sensitive variables increase, populations meeting at the intersectionality of these variables may simply not exist or may not be large enough to provide accurate samples for classification. In these increasingly likely scenarios, we make the case for human intervention and applying situational and individual definitions of fairness. In this paper we present lower bounds of subgroup sample complexity for metric-fair learning based on the theory of Probably Approximately Metric Fair Learning. We demonstrate that for a classifier to approach a definition of fairness in terms of specific sensitive variables, adequate subgroup population samples need to exist and the model dimensionality has to be aligned with subgroup population distributions.  In cases where this is not feasible, we propose an approach using individual fairness definitions for achieving alignment.  We look at two commonly explored UCI datasets under this lens and suggest human interventions for data collection for specific subgroups to achieve approximate individual fairness for linear hypotheses.</details><br/>

## In Short

In recent years, AI systems have become both more powerful and increasingly promising for integration in a variety of application areas. Attention has also been called to the social challenges these systems bring, particularly in how they might fail or even actively disadvantage marginalised social groups, or how their opacity might make them difficult to oversee and challenge. In the context of these and other challenges, the roles of humans working in tandem with these systems will be important, yet the HCI community has been only a quiet voice in these debates to date. **This workshop aims to catalyse and crystallise an agenda around HCI and AI**. Topics of interest (See [Guiding Research Questions](#guiding-research-questions)) include methods to collaboratively explore AI systems to identify unusual failure modes; identifying, methods to capture and replicate social practices of critical engagement and oversight with AI systems; integrating insights from AI systems with complementary human insights; avoiding over- and under-reliance while preserving enjoyable user experiences; creating useable ML/AI systems for HCI practitioners; and modes of engagement with novel AI 'users', such as those captured and represented in training sets.

## Call for Participation

**We invite submissions for a one-day workshop to discuss critical questions in bringing the human into the development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) systems.**

Papers should be **2-4 pages long** in the [CHI Extended Abstract](https://chi2019.acm.org/authors/chi-proceedings-format/) format, and may address any topics related to the intersections of HCI, AI, and machine learning. This includes but is not limited to ongoing work; reflections on past work; combining methods from HCI and design to AI; and emergent ethical, political, and social challenges. A set of **[guiding research questions](#guiding-research-questions)** has been provided below for guidance.

The **due date for submissions is no later than February 12, 2019**. [The submission site is here](https://ai-hci19.hotcrp.com/). Participants will be selected based on the quality and clarity of their submissions as they reflect the interests of the workshop. Notifications will go out no later than March 1, 2019. At least one author of each accepted position paper must attend the workshop, and all participants must register for both the workshop and at least one day of the conference.

Participants will be selected based on their prior experience and interest in the workshop as well as the quality of their submissions. We will focus on recruiting from a diverse group of participants, with a balance of students and faculty; industry practitioners and academic audiences; contribution areas within HCI and AI research; and representation of different cultures, genders, and ethnic backgrounds.

## Context

Advances in deep machine learning as well as hardware have pushed the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. By developing machine learning (ML) techniques to process large volumes and modalities of data, by turning voluminous sources of data into signals, and by providing robust predictions of critical outcomes, AI systems can both supplement and replace human-decision making \[36\]. AI has begun to make great strides in many problems of societal significance and has already made contributions to tasks like development and poverty \[21\], education \[18\], agriculture and the environment \[10,33\], and healthcare \[22\]. At the same time, AI has begun to expand our ability to make important decisions in business, law, finance, and politics \[2,3,6,13,23,25,32\], to more easily reach and help vulnerable populations \[7,8,20\], to predict health and wellbeing \[5,9\], to more quickly detect people at risk of poor outcomes and provide early interventions \[31\], and sometimes to identify actionable or personalized solutions \[4,19\].

However, in recent years, with the pervasive adoption and prevalence of AI systems in real-world contexts, they have also raised the concerns of both researchers and practitioners for issues of bias, accountability, fairness, and discrimination. To solve these problems, machine learning researchers and practitioners have focused on providing mathematical insights to correct issues such as bias, discrimination, and transparency of algorithm choice. These researchers have focused on improving the algorithms themselves to correct for bias \[11,17,30\] and improve interpretability \[28,38\]. This area has seend tremendous group in the past few years as can be seen in the many outlets for this work including the [ACM Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAT\*) conference](www.fatconference.org) and multiple iterations of FAT- workshops (FAT/ML for recommendations, FATREC for recommender systems, etc) at premier ML conferences. This work is providing important computational prerequisites and scaffolding necessary for responsible deployment of machine learning.

However, the **human** is still a critical, if not the central component of many scenarios where AI is being advocated as both an assistant or augmentation for human intelligence. While most AI systems offer robust empirical performance for real-world problems, many of these approaches are developed opaquely and in isolation, without appropriate involvement of the human stakeholders who use these systems or are most affected by them. As the following fictional exemplar implies \[26\]: "*\[..\] we can't just tell the doctor 'my neural network says this patient has cancer!' The doctor just won't accept that!*". Human involvement in AI system design, development, and evaluation is critical \[16\] to ensure that the insights being derived are practical, and the systems built are meaningful and relatable to those who need them. Some recent HCI work has focussed on adoption issues of this kind \[35,37\], but it remains unclear how the characteristics of emerging AI technologies may interact with existing understanding around decision-support or expert systems in-the-wild.

It is also important to prevent unintended consequences, and alleviate various risks stemming from bias, errors, irresponsible use, misaligned expectations, privacy concerns, and potential issues around lack of trust, interpretability, and accountability. Moreover, human activities and behaviors are deeply contextual, nuanced, and laden with subjectivity -- aspects that many current AI systems often fail to account for adequately \[24\]. We need to be able to transcribe AI systems in interactive, usable, and actionable technologies that function in the natural contexts of all human stakeholders in a bias-free manner. This, in turn, requires augmenting these systems with orthogonal but complementary human-centered insights, that go beyond aggregated assessments and inferences to ones that factor in individuals' differences, demands, values, expectations, and preferences \[12,29\]. Finally, the success of AI systems in the real world requires multi-disciplinary partnerships who bring diverse perspectives to solve these problems which are as much human problems as they are AI.

Summarily, despite the importance of people in the development, deployment, and use of AI systems, Human Computer Interaction (HCI) is often not a core component of these research questions. While AI researchers have recently begun to note this important gap in popular discourse, e.g., "*Despite its name, there is nothing 'artificial' about this technology -- it is made by humans, intended to behave like humans and affects humans. So if we want it to play a positive role in tomorrow's world, it must be guided by human concerns*."[^2], we argue that more comprehensive inclusion of HCI's unique perspectives are essential to solving these challenging societal questions. Therefore, through this workshop, we ask the fundamental question: *Where is the human in AI research?*

Guiding Research Questions
=====================================

Our workshop provides an opportunity for researchers and practitioners interested in the intersection of HCI and AI to come together to share interests and discuss ways to move the field forward. We provide a set of guiding questions for the community to consider:

1.  **Explainable and Explorable AI**: What does the human need to effectively utilize AI insights? How can users explore AI systems' results and logic to identify failure modes that might not be easy to spot? Examples might be undesirable impacts on latent groups not corresponding to categories in the dataset \[34\], difficult-to-spot changes ('concept drift'), or feedback loops in the socio-technical phenomena the AI system is modelling over time \[14\].

2.  **Documentation and Review:** Some work is beginning to understand how models and datasets might be documented in context \[15,27\]. Something less considered, but called for by practitioners on-the-ground \[35\], is how social routines supporting oversight, human-AI synergy, etc, might be effectively packaged up and documented, particularly in new or changing environments with high staff turnover, or in the context of model trading.

3.  **Integrating Artificial and Human Intelligence**: AI systems and humans both have unique abilities and are typically better at certain complementary tasks than others. For instance, while AI systems can summarize voluminous data to identify latent patterns, humans can extract meaningful, relatable, and theoretically grounded insights from such patterns. What kind of research designs or problems are most amenable to and would benefit the most from combining artificial and human intelligence? What challenges might surface in attempting to do so?

4.  **Collaborative Decision Making**: How can we harness the best of humans and algorithms to make better decisions than either alone? How do we ensure that when there is a human-in-the-loop---such as in complex or life-changing decision-making---they remain critical and meaningful, while creating and maintaining an enjoyable user experience? Where is the line between decision support anticipating the needs of the user and it removing the user's ability to bring in novel, qualitative critical knowledge to enable the system's goals?

5.  **AI/ML in the HCI Design Process**: How can algorithmic tools be made more readily accessible during the HCI design process to those whose expertise lies outside of machine learning, and computer science more broadly? What are some successful AI-HCI collaborations? What made them work? Where do the barriers exist and how might we overcome them?

6.  **Representing Diverse Human Roles and Relationships in AI Systems**: AI systems often involve humans in capacities other than the traditional \"user\"; for instance, individuals who conceptualize the system, the developers, the people who evaluate the underlying machine learning models, and those whose data the system draws from to make inferences (human stakeholders). What approaches -- across the design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment processes -- help account for the variety of relationships that people have with AI systems?

7.  **Critical Views of AI**: Work in fields such as science and technology studies (STS), media studies, and other areas has examined the social, political, and economic ramifications of AI systems \[16\]. To date, little of such work has been incorporated into HCI \[1\]. How can critical perspectives be brought into a meaningful, productive dialog with design- and implementation-oriented work? In short, how do we foster a productive dialog between researchers

**Next Steps**. Brainstorm important next steps to continue these conversations and strengthen the community of HCI researchers working on Human+AI problems and facilitate rich collaborations with others disciplines. Additionally, we will discuss ways we can have broader impact by ensuring that this topic is central to HCI education.
